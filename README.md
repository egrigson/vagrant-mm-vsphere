# vagrant-mm-vsphere
A multi-machine Vagrant configuration

These files were created to allow users to use Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com) to quickly and relatively easily spin up an instance of VMware Photon (container-optimized Linux distribution). The configuration was tested using Vagrant 1.7.2, VMware Fusion 6.0.5, and the Vagrant VMware plugin.
